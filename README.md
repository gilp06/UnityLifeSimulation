# UnityLifeSimulation
Evolution/Life thingy made in unity inspired by the Bibites. Extremely WIP.

Uses something similar to NEAT but the fitness is replaced with just being able to reproduce.
Code was made referencing Python-NEAT and SharpNEAT however I have no clue if I am actually optimizing this correctly.
Mechanics were my interpretations from the Bibites videos, the settings probably need some tweaking still.
